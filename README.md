## Getting Started

To run this project on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alearevalo/transcript-ai.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd transcript-ai
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    # or
    bun install
    ```

4. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
    ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

6. You can now start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page will auto-update as you edit the file.

**Note:** Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine for the project to work properly.

Happy coding!
